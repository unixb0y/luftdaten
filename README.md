# luftdaten
My version of the luftdaten.info fine dust sensor

I first tried using a 3d printed case, but then found a pretty perfectly sized lunchbox that had a semi-transparent lid which I really liked.  
So I went with that for the outer case and then on the inside mounted both the sensor itself and the MCU on a little 3d printed part so it all stays together nicely.
For the wiring, I put a few headers on a piece of prototyping board so that I can easily swap the MCU if it fails or if it has to be re-flashed etc., also this way it was just easier to mount!  
See the pictures for more details and the [3d printed part on Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2811064).
